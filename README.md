# Hierarchical Two-Agent Empathetic Conversational Recommender System

This project is my MSc thesis implementation, exploring whether a hierarchical multi-agent structure (emotion & intent recognizer â†’ knowledge-enhanced empathetic recommender) can outperform the single-agent approach in empathy and recommendation accuracy.

## Structure
- `data/`: Raw, processed, and external knowledge datasets
- `src/agents/`: Modular agent definitions (emotion+intent recognizer, knowledge-enhanced recommender)
- `scripts/`: Preprocessing, training, and evaluation scripts
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory Jupyter notebooks
- `experiments/` and `results/`: Logs, outputs, and metrics
